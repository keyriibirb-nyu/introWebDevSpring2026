# Mapo Tofu Recipe
## Taiwanese-American Homestyle Version
### Written by Kieran Jones
This is a style of mapo tofu that deviates from the original Sichuan version. 
Instead of the Sichuan peppercorn's signature *mala* spice, 
this version leans more into ground pork's savory potential.

### Setup
1. Combine the sauce ingredients in a medium bowl, whisk to combine. Set sauce aside.

1. Heat a large frying pan to medium-high heat.
    Add 2 tbsp neutral oil to the hot pan. 
    Add the garlic, ginger, and green onion whites.  
2. Saute, stirring frequently, until aromatics are fragrant, 1-2 minutes.
3. Add ground pork, stirring frequently and breaking up chunks, until pork is no longer pink.
4. Turn the heat down to medium. 
            Add the sauce to the pan, stirring frequently, until the sauce begins to simmer.

            Coat the tofu with sauce, and stir occasionally until tofu is heated through.
6. Stir in green onion greens, then remove mapo tofu from the heat. Serve over white rice.
