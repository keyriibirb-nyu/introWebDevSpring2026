## Navigation in Terminal

ls
lists what the terminal can see —> indicates location

cd folder_name
change depository, moves terminal location into the folder
can also type cd and then drag in a folder —> will go into that folder

cd ../
change depository to previous/higher

mkdir
make directory, creates a folder wherever the terminal is

git clone github_link
clones an existing GitHub depository



## How to push files

git status
when inside the GitHub depository, shows any un-uploaded files

git add . 
gets ready to add all un-uploaded files

git commit -m “comments about what is uploaded”
look for main -> main

git push
pushes the files



## When changes have been made:
git pull
Pulls any new updates from GitHub into the clone folder





Testing out if access keys will work to push work from VSCode to here:
Access key

git remote set-url origin https://keyriibirb-nyu:birbaccesstoken@github.com/keyriibirb-nyu/repo.git
